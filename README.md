First open the terminal in the OUTPUT folder and type the following command:

```bash
cd ..;gcc main.c shapes.c point.c line.c circle.c square.c rectangle.c polygon.c input.c display.c -o ".\output\main.exe"; cd output; ./main.exe
```

It should compile and run the program.


OR go in the folder "Vector-based-image-editor-in-c\cmake-build-debug" and run "Vector_based_image_editor_in_c.exe"
